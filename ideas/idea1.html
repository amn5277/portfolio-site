        <p style="text-align: justify;"> What Excites me and at the same time fasicantes me is human behaviour, Question is why? The     answer : We humans have devloped certain behaviours over the long history of 
            our known existence,behioviour that drives and makes us to do things.Alot of people/organization/groups have tried understanding those behaviour to influence and exploit us for there own purposes wheather good or bad is debatable.
            .Though not a very new idea but what is a very intresting problem to think about is how can we use these behaviours that really makes us do things that we do 
            to enable us rather than exploting us. This has been attemped by a lot of humans throught various mediums at places like
            <a styles="text-decoration:none" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Behavior_Design_Lab">Stanford Behaviour Design Labs</a>
            but it was not very either the ideas were not very succesful on a large scale or  if they were it mostly exploited us throught products like Instagram.

            The Cliche's as always are true , it takes more energy and power to do the good than what it takes to do the bad
